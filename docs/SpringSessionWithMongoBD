How Does it Work?
----------------
Let's take a look at what goes on in the Spring session behind the scenes.

The SessionRepositoryFilter is responsible for most of the work:

converts the HttpSession into a MongoSession
checks if there's a Cookie present, and if so, loads the session data from the store
saves the updated session data in the store
checks the validity of the session
Also, the SessionRepositoryFilter creates a cookie with the name SESSION that is HttpOnly and secure. 
This cookie contains the session id, which is a Base64-encoded value.
