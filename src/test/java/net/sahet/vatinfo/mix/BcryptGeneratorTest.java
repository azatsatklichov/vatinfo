	 * What is Bcrypt Encoding
	 * 
	 * As per wiki, bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos
	 * and David Mazi√®res, based on the Blowfish cipher. Bcrypt uses adaptive hash
	 * algorithm to store password.BCrypt internally generates a random salt while
	 * encoding passwords and hence it is obvious to get different encoded results
	 * for the same string.But one common thing is that everytime it generates a
	 * String of length 60.
